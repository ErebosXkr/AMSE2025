They are known as “Hunters”. However, not all Hunters are powerful. My name is Sung Jin-Woo, an E-rank Hunter. I’m someone who has to risk his life in the lowliest of dungeons, the “World’s Weakest”. Having no skills whatsoever to display, I barely earned the required money by fighting in low-leveled dungeons… at least until I found a hidden dungeon with the hardest difficulty within the D-rank dungeons! In the end, as I was accepting death, I suddenly received a strange power, a quest log that only I could see, a secret to leveling up that only I know about! If I trained in accordance with my quests and hunted monsters, my level would rise. Changing from the weakest Hunter to the strongest S-rank Hunter!\n\n---\n**Links:**\n\n- Official English Translation [<Pocket Comics>](https://www.pocketcomics.com/comic/320) | [<WebNovel>](https://www.webnovel.com/comic/only-i-level-up-(solo-leveling)_15227640605485101) | [<Tapas>](https://tapas.io/series/solo-leveling-comic/info)\n- Alternate Official Raw - [Kakao Webtoon](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/나-혼자만-레벨업/2320)",

Astina decides to sell herself off to marry Grand Duke Thereode in place of her sister Kanna to save her family from their financial crisis. But Thereode is forever cursed to take on the form of a beast, and no one expects her to survive the night with him…\n\nStill, defying all odds, she fights the beast with her impressive swordsmanship, and miraculously survives. Over time, a slow relationship begins to kindle between them as she tames him as her pet.\n\n---\nFollowing a life of bloodshed and heartbreak, the great Empress Martina is reborn as Astina, the genius daughter of a humble count. But her peaceful world is shattered when bankruptcy forces her father to marry her off to the dangerous Archduke Atalenta. All of high society knows him as \"Theriod the Beast\" because of a family curse that turned him into a wild monster. Luckily, even the deadly beast of Atalenta is no match for the former empress's mighty sword. \n\nEveryone is shocked when the new archduchess tames her husband all too easily and takes over as the family head. No one's more surprised than Astina, however, when her casual kiss returns Theriod to his human form. Not only does he resemble her past life lover, but he has no memory of her from his wolf days.

The moment where Ren was about to give up the search, he decided to start playing the second round of the game.\n\nSuddenly, a notification message “Do you want to start a special story?\" appeared on the screen.\n\nWhen Ren chose “Yes” without hesitation, he lost consciousness, and when he woke up, he was a baby. —Could it be that he was reincarnated as one of the heroes in *The Legend of the Seven Heroes*? Ren, who thought such a thing was impossible, could not believe his ears when he heard his name from his mother's mouth. It was the name of a classmate who betrays the heroes in the middle of the story.\n\nOf course, he wishes to live in peace. But he meets a saint whose life he's supposed to take, and doesn't. Furthermore, he ends up saving a character (the boss of a great noble family) who was supposed to die. All of these things creates a development that he doesn't know about coming to play…\n\n---\n**Original Web Novel:** [Kakuyomu](https://kakuyomu.jp/works/16816700427572694145),  [Syosetu](https://ncode.syosetu.com/n1862hs/)",

Saki stutters an apology, but the girl simply hands back her sheet music and leaves without a word. Saki begins her first day of high school the following morning, only to find the stranger from the night before sitting at the desk next to hers. She learns that the girl’s name is Kanon and that she is not quite completely deaf, but very hard of hearing. Though Kanon needs to be close to people to read their lips, she tends to push people away with her icy demeanor. Through one kind gesture, Saki slowly begins breaking down the walls around Kanon, even as she feels something new blossoming within her.",
